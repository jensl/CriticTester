Critic Tester
=============

Testing basics
--------------

The testing done by the Critic Tester system is dynamically determined by the
state of the review branch at any given time.  This is the actual review branch
-- the set of commits shown by the <code>[actual log]</code> link if the review
has been rebased, not (necessarily) the set of commits listed on the review
front-page.

When the review branch is updated, whether by pushing additional commits to it
or by rebasing it, the set of tests to run is recalculated.  This may lead to
new tests being scheduled for running, and/or to old test results being
discarded.

All tests run for any given branch must be successful -- show no errors or
warnings -- for the review to be considered to have a clean testing record.
This means that no commit that has testing issues may be integrated, even if the
issues are fixed by later commits in the same review.  The review branch must be
rebased first so that the commit that fixes the issue precedes the commit with
the issue, or by squashing the fix into the commit with the issue.

Calculation of tests to run
---------------------------

Individual tests to run are calculated by selecting a set of commits out of the
commits on the review branch, and then generating a set of test runs per
selected commit.  Each test run is then executed in a number of different VM
instances with different supported operating systems installed.

Commit selection
----------------
The commits to test are selected as follows:

* On a "clean" branch with no fixup! or squash! commits, every commit is
  selected.

* On an "unclean" branch, the same set of commits are selected, except that each
  commit is represented by its final fixup! or squash! commit, if it has one.

* When a "real" commit is represented by its final fixup! or squash!, every
  commit between the real commit and the final fixup! or squash! is disqualified
  from testing.  This may mean that some "real" commits are not selected at all.

The theory is that every commit that has a later fixup! or squash!, and any
commit in between, are broken, and that testing them is a waste of time, and a
source of noise.  It is assumed that a branch containing fixup! or squash!
commits will be rebased before being merged to master, and on that rebased
branch, free from fixup! or squash! commits, each and every real commit is
ultimately tested before integration.

It can also be noted that at least the tip of the branch is always selected, by
applying these rules.

Per-commit testing
------------------
Each commit selected for testing is tested in a few different ways:

* Installed directly.

* Upgraded from each of its immediate parents.  For a commit represented by its
  final fixup! or squash! commit, the immediate parents are the parents of the
  original commit, not the fixup! or squash! commit.

The commit at the tip of the review branch is tested in some additional ways:

* Upgraded from each of the review's upstreams (typically its merge-base with
  master.)

* Upgraded from each commit referenced by refs/heads/historic/* in the
  repository.

There may be an overlap -- the review's upstreams may also be the immediate
parent of the commit at the tip of the review branch.  Such overlap is
eliminated; only one instance of each unique test is run.
